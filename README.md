# Vulgate Frontend

This project is a React + TypeScript application styled with Tailwind CSS. It communicates with a backend API to fetch biblical texts, analyze verses and play audio.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
2. Start the development server with `npm start`.
3. The application assumes the API is available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1`. You can change the base URL in `src/App.tsx` by modifying `API_BASE_URL`.

## Building

Run `npm run build` to create a production build in the `build` directory.

## Testing

Unit tests can be executed with `npm test`. This repository currently contains only the default Create React App tests.
